### Hackathon 2022, at Microsoft, 11 Times Square, New York, NY
## Problem: Visualize Google mobility data during Covid-19. Created in partnership with Microsoft and the University of Oxford, the A tale of two cities - Exploring the future of work - A Data AI hackathon. 
I used GeoPandas to create monthly maps of the U.S. and incorporated Photoshop to animate all the maps. This animation showcased Google mobility data for the retail industry only. You might be wondering, why Photoshop? Well, faced with a tight 24-hour deadline and a commitment to timely delivery, I decided to think creatively. I recognized that hackathons aren't the best place to learn something entirely new; they're meant for putting existing skills into practice. So, I opted for a familiar tool. Considering my role as a seller across various marketplaces, this project held personal significance. It was driven by my curiosity about customer behavior during the COVID-19 pandemic that I witnessed, and my aim was to uncover answers to some of my questions.

## What is Google Mobility Data? 
Google tracks the majority of us (unless you opt out), and that cozy convenient feature that we use - GPS - is feeding these datasets which I had the pleasure to analyze. 
In this repo, I only show a sample of one of 3 input files `Sample of 2022_US_Region_Mobility_Report - 2022_US_Region_Mobility_Report` as they are too big to be accepted by GitHub. Full sizes are available in my Google disk, please ask for them: [email](mailto:xeniya.shoiko@outlook.com). The pandemic affected different sectors of the economy differently. Technology and e-commerce companies, for example, benefited from increased demand for online services, while industries like travel, hospitality, and energy faced significant challenges. Given the nature of data, this is a view on only physical mobility in/out of retail spaces and not the industry as a whole.
## Why PR, AS, GU, etc. are not showing?
I can only speculate, but I guess someone in Google pre-cleaned these datasets that I received and territories were excluded.
# Result
These are the U.S. map of month-by-month snapshots combined and stacked together and spun on an infinite loop in 3-year observation. Here, warm colors indicate an increase in traffic to retail spaces, while cooler shades represent retail locations experiencing abandonment. 

# Observations
- Fun fact, I saw an abnormal surge in March 2020 of people moving into retail spaces and I went to Google News to find out the reason for the map turning yellow. We all remember it by a "Toilet Paper Panic" as one of Coronavirus panics that was perfectly demonstrated by my color map [BBC article](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-australia-51731422) 

- Another question I asked: "WHY AT THIS TIME?" 
You might know about the lowest interest rates in decades, (use at 5Y setting) [United States Fed Funds Rate](https://tradingeconomics.com/united-states/interest-rate#:~:text=Interest%20Rate%20in%20the%20United,percent%20in%20December%20of%202008.) .
GPT has something to contribute here too:

"A low-interest rate environment can have both positive and negative effects on retail businesses, depending on various factors. Here's how low-interest rates can impact the retail sector:

  **Positive Effects:**
  - Increased Consumer Spending
  - Lower Borrowing Costs
  - Higher Disposable Income

  **Negative Effects:**
  - Reduced Savings and Investments
  - Impact on Fixed-Income Consumers
  - Shift to Online Shopping
  - Consumer Confidence"

The Federal Reserve (commonly referred to as the Fed) did lower interest rates in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Initially, people found themselves at home with extra funds due to reduced commuting, dining out, and other expenses. This led them to redirect their attention and, well, their fingers, towards online spending. (Oh, My sales would never surpass those of March 2020!) An eventual end to super-cheap money - the Fed began to raise the rate, a natural decline in spending became evident. This shift is reflected in the overall color palette of the graph, which turns cooler the further into the future we look.

February 2021 was particularly chilling, with a frosty shade of purple enveloping my graph. Yahoo! news articles confirmed the downturn, with headlines like: "European and United States stock futures were a sea of red.", "Wall Street slides in worst tech selloff", "Thousands of jobs at risk in Asda online restructuring", "Nasdaq suffers biggest slump since October" These headlines reflected a prevailing mood of doom and gloom among the news outlets, underscoring the economic slowdown signaled by major stock market indices.
